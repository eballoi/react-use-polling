# @eballoi/react-use-polling

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

In this changeset, we've been very productive:

- We introduced tests to our codebase. Yes, tests! It's like our code is finally getting its regular checkup at the doctor's office. We're keeping those pesky bugs at bay.

- We also gave our README file a makeover. It was feeling a bit underdressed, so we added some spiffy new documentation to make it look good at parties.

- Our package.json got a little love too. We updated it with some minor fixes, just to keep things running smoothly.

Our codebase is happier and healthier now. 🚀
